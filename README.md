## Price Fitting

### Overview

This project explores the concept of Price Fitting in algorithmic trading. The initial attempt involved fitting a polynomial directly with the in-sample data. However, this approach proved to be unsuccessful when applied to the out-of-sample data.

### Challenges Encountered

The primary reason for the failure was identified as overfitting. Fitting a polynomial directly to the in-sample data led to an obvious error when extrapolated to the out-of-sample data. This experience underscores the importance of robust methodologies to avoid overfitting issues in algorithmic trading strategies.

## Future Work

While the initial attempt faced challenges, the project remains a work in progress. Future iterations will focus on refining the fitting approach and exploring alternative methods to achieve more accurate and reliable results.
